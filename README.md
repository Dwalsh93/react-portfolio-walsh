Relatively user friendly, this SPA has a navigation bar along the top that defaults the user to the "About Page", other active, working links include a contact page, a projects page, a resume link that allows you to download my resume as a PDF, and finally the link to my github page. On the bottom of the webpage are three icons that allow you to email me directly, view my linkedIn page, and another link to my github account.
